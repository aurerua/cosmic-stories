# meteor-stories
This web site is a loose clone of [everydaysexism.com](http://www.everydaysexism.com) and enables people to post stories online anonymously, without them having to log in.

There is a demo at [http://meteorstories.meteor.com)](http://meteorstories.meteor.com).

The main functionalities have been implemented using the following Meteor packages:

- for Forms: aldeed:autoform,
- for Pagination: alethes:pages,
- for the reCAPTCHA: appshore:recaptcha,
- and to pass data from autoform to the server, Server Session: matteodem:server-session.
