# meteor-stories
This web site is a loose clone of [everydaysexism.com](http://www.everydaysexism.com) in terms of functionalities. It enables people to post stories online anonymously, without them having to log in.

There is a demo at [http://meteorstories.meteor.com](http://meteorstories.meteor.com).

The main functionalities have been implemented using the following Meteor packages:

- for Forms [https://github.com/aldeed/meteor-autoform](aldeed:autoform),
- for Pagination [https://github.com/alethes/meteor-pages](alethes:pages),
- for the reCAPTCHA [https://github.com/appshore/Meteor-reCAPTCHA](appshore:recaptcha),
- and to pass data from autoform to the server, Server Session [https://github.com/matteodem/meteor-server-session](matteodem:server-session).
