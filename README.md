Everyday Stories is a Meteor web site which enables people to post stories online
anonymously, without them having to log in.

##Aim
In terms of functionalities (and thus the name) it has been built as a loose clone of [everydaysexism.com](http://www.everydaysexism.com). 

##TODOs
- Add an admin user who can remove stories if necessary
- Improve layout for small devices
